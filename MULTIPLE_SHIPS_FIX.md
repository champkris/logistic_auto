# ✅ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Multiple Ships Support

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**BEFORE** (❌ BROKEN):
```
2:00 PM - Ask about Ship A (MAKHA BHUM / 119S) → Cached for 3 hours
2:10 PM - Ask about Ship B (ALOHA BOBA / 7889K) → BLOCKED! ❌
```

The system only checked `group_id` + `last_asked_at`, so asking about **any ship** within 3 hours would be blocked.

**AFTER** (✅ FIXED):
```
2:00 PM - Ask about Ship A (MAKHA BHUM / 119S) → Cached for 3 hours ✅
2:10 PM - Ask about Ship B (ALOHA BOBA / 7889K) → Asks immediately ✅
2:15 PM - Ask about Ship A again → Returns cached data ✅
5:05 PM - Ask about Ship A again → Asks new (3+ hours passed) ✅
```

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### File: `SiamComChatbotEtaRequestController.php`

**BEFORE:**
```php
// Only checked group_id (WRONG!)
$etaRequest = SiamComChatbotEtaRequest::where('group_id', $groupId)->first();
```

**AFTER:**
```php
// Now checks group_id + vessel_name + voyage_code (CORRECT!)
$etaRequest = SiamComChatbotEtaRequest::where('group_id', $groupId)
    ->where('vessel_name', $data['vessel_name'])
    ->where('voyage_code', $data['voyage_code'])
    ->first();
```

## 📊 Database Schema

Each ship now gets its **own cached record**:

| id | group_id | vessel_name | voyage_code | last_known_eta | last_asked_at | status |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | C763c... | MAKHA BHUM | 119S | 2025-09-21 07:30 | 2025-09-30 14:00 | COMPLETE |
| 2 | C763c... | ALOHA BOBA | 7889K | 2025-09-22 08:00 | 2025-09-30 14:10 | COMPLETE |
| 3 | C763c... | OCEAN STAR | 456N | 2025-09-23 09:30 | 2025-09-30 14:20 | COMPLETE |

## ✅ Cache Logic Now Works Correctly

### Scenario 1: Same Ship Within 3 Hours
```
Time: 2:00 PM - Ship A asked
Time: 2:30 PM - Ship A asked again

Result: Returns cached data ✅
Reason: Same (group_id + vessel + voyage) + < 3 hours
```

### Scenario 2: Different Ship
```
Time: 2:00 PM - Ship A asked
Time: 2:10 PM - Ship B asked

Result: Asks chatbot immediately ✅
Reason: Different (vessel + voyage) = new cache entry
```

### Scenario 3: Same Ship After 3 Hours
```
Time: 2:00 PM - Ship A asked
Time: 5:05 PM - Ship A asked again

Result: Asks chatbot again ✅
Reason: Same ship but > 3 hours passed
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Ships Simultaneously
```
Time: 2:00 PM - Ship A asked → Asking chatbot
Time: 2:01 PM - Ship B asked → Asking chatbot
Time: 2:02 PM - Ship C asked → Asking chatbot

Result: All 3 handled independently ✅
Reason: Each has separate cache entry
```

## 🧪 How To Test

### Test 1: Two Different Ships
```bash
# Test Ship A
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/vessel-test-public/siam/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vessel_name":"MAKHA BHUM","voyage_code":"119S"}'

# Wait 10 seconds

# Test Ship B (should work immediately, not blocked)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/vessel-test-public/siam/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vessel_name":"ALOHA BOBA","voyage_code":"7889K"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Ship A: `action: "ask_new"` (first time)
- Ship B: `action: "ask_new"` (first time, different ship)

### Test 2: Same Ship Twice
```bash
# Test Ship A
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/vessel-test-public/siam/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vessel_name":"MAKHA BHUM","voyage_code":"119S"}'

# Wait for admin response (assume ETA is saved)

# Test Ship A again within 3 hours
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/vessel-test-public/siam/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vessel_name":"MAKHA BHUM","voyage_code":"119S"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
- First request: `action: "ask_new"`
- Second request: `action: "return_cached"` with ETA data

### Test 3: From Browser
1. Test Ship A: MAKHA BHUM / 119S → Wait for result
2. Test Ship B: ALOHA BOBA / 7889K → Should work immediately
3. Test Ship A again → Should show cached data
4. Check database:
```sql
SELECT id, vessel_name, voyage_code, status, last_asked_at, last_known_eta 
FROM siam_com_chatbot_eta_requests 
ORDER BY last_asked_at DESC;
```

---

## 📝 Database Query Examples

### Get all cached ships:
```sql
SELECT 
    vessel_name, 
    voyage_code, 
    last_known_eta,
    last_asked_at,
    status,
    ROUND((julianday('now') - julianday(last_asked_at)) * 24, 2) as hours_ago
FROM siam_com_chatbot_eta_requests
WHERE status = 'COMPLETE'
ORDER BY last_asked_at DESC;
```

### Check cache for specific ship:
```sql
SELECT * FROM siam_com_chatbot_eta_requests
WHERE vessel_name = 'MAKHA BHUM' 
  AND voyage_code = '119S'
ORDER BY last_asked_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Find ships asked in last 3 hours:
```sql
SELECT 
    vessel_name,
    voyage_code,
    last_asked_at,
    status
FROM siam_com_chatbot_eta_requests
WHERE last_asked_at >= datetime('now', '-3 hours')
ORDER BY last_asked_at DESC;
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

### What Now Works:
✅ Each ship has its own cache (separate by vessel_name + voyage_code)
✅ Multiple ships can be asked within 3 hours without conflict
✅ Each ship's cache expires independently (3 hours per ship)
✅ Same ship within 3 hours returns cached data
✅ Different ships are never blocked by each other

### Cache Key Structure:
```
Cache Key = group_id + vessel_name + voyage_code + last_asked_at

Examples:
- C763c... + MAKHA BHUM + 119S → Separate cache
- C763c... + ALOHA BOBA + 7889K → Separate cache
- C763c... + OCEAN STAR + 456N → Separate cache
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database will grow**: Each unique ship creates a new record
2. **Consider cleanup**: Add job to delete old records (e.g., > 30 days)
3. **Unique constraint**: Consider adding index on (group_id, vessel_name, voyage_code)

### Recommended Index:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_vessel_cache ON siam_com_chatbot_eta_requests(
    group_id, 
    vessel_name, 
    voyage_code, 
    last_asked_at
);
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED and READY FOR TESTING

**Your solution was PERFECT!** The fix ensures that different ships berthing at SIAM Commercial terminal are handled independently! 🚢⚓
