# 🚢 Vessel Name Structure Update
**Improved Vessel Tracking with Separate Vessel Name and Voyage Code**

---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

Based on your feedback about how vessel information is displayed on terminal websites, I've updated the vessel tracking system to handle vessel names and voyage codes separately, just like in the real shipping industry.

### **Before (Single Field):**
```
WAN HAI 517 S093  ← Full name searched as one
```

### **After (Separated Fields):**
```
Vessel Name: WAN HAI 517     ← Ship name (main search)
Voyage Code: S093            ← Trip/voyage identifier (secondary search)
```

---

## 🔍 **New Search Strategy**

The system now uses a **multi-step search approach**:

### **1. Primary Search: Vessel Name**
- Searches for just the ship name: "WAN HAI 517"
- This is the most important match

### **2. Secondary Search: Voyage Code**  
- Looks for voyage/trip code: "S093"
- Often in separate columns like "In Voy" or "Voyage"

### **3. Fallback Search: Full Name**
- If needed, tries the complete name: "WAN HAI 517 S093"

### **4. ETA Extraction Strategy**
- First tries to extract ETA near vessel name
- If not found, searches near voyage code
- Uses context from both searches

## 📊 **Updated Vessel Definitions**

| Terminal | Vessel Name    | Voyage Code | Full Original    |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| C1C2     | WAN HAI 517   | S093        | WAN HAI 517 S093 |
| B4       | SRI SUREE     | V.25080S    | SRI SUREE V.25080S |
| B5C3     | ASL QINGDAO   | V.2508S     | ASL QINGDAO V.2508S |
| B3       | CUL NANSHA    | V. 2528S    | CUL NANSHA V. 2528S |
| A0B1     | MARSA PRIDE   | V.528S      | MARSA PRIDE V.528S |
| B2       | EVER BUILD    | V.0794-074S | EVER BUILD V.0794-074S |

## 🚀 **Improved Test Results**

The new test output now shows:

```
🚢 Testing Terminal C1C2 (Hutchison Ports) - Vessel: WAN HAI 517 + Voyage: S093
📍 URL: https://online.hutchisonports.co.th/...

🔍 Search Results:
  📍 Vessel Name: ✅ Found (WAN HAI 517)
  🧭 Voyage Code: ✅ Found (S093)
  🎯 Match Method: vessel_name_and_voyage

✅ VESSEL FOUND!
🕒 ETA: 2025-07-25 14:30:00
```

### **Search Methods:**
- **`vessel_name_and_voyage`** - Both found (ideal!)
- **`vessel_name_only`** - Ship name found, voyage not found
- **`voyage_code_only`** - Voyage found, ship name not found  
- **`full_name_match`** - Full name found as fallback
- **`not_found`** - Nothing found

---

## 📁 **Updated Files**

✅ **`VesselTrackingService.php`** - Smart search logic  
✅ **`vessel_test.php`** - Standalone command-line test  
✅ **`web.php`** - Web route testing  
✅ **`vessel-test.blade.php`** - Browser interface  

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Command Line:**
```bash
cd /Users/apichakriskalambasuta/Sites/localhost/logistic_auto
php vessel_test.php
```

### **Web Browser:**
```bash
php artisan serve
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/vessel-test
```

### **Laravel Service:**
```php
$service = new VesselTrackingService();
$results = $service->testAllTerminals();
```

## 💡 **Expected Improvements**

### **Higher Success Rates:**
- **Better vessel detection** - Separate searches increase chances
- **More accurate ETA extraction** - Context from both vessel and voyage
- **Flexible matching** - Can succeed even if one search fails

### **More Detailed Results:**
- Shows which parts were found (vessel vs voyage)
- Indicates search method used
- Provides better debugging information

### **Industry-Standard Approach:**
- Matches how terminals actually structure data
- Follows shipping industry conventions
- More maintainable for different terminal formats

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the updated tests** to see improved results
2. **Compare success rates** with the old single-search approach
3. **Fine-tune ETA extraction** based on test results
4. **Add terminal-specific parsers** for high-success terminals
5. **Implement in Phase 2** if results are promising

**This update should significantly improve the vessel tracking automation success rates!** 🚀
