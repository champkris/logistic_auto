# 🔐 Root Route Update - Dashboard Redirect

## ✅ **Update Complete!**

The root route (`/`) now redirects directly to the dashboard and requires authentication, creating a streamlined user experience for your logistics system.

---

## 🚀 **What Changed**

### **🔄 Route Behavior**
- ✅ **Root Route (`/`)** → Now redirects to Dashboard
- ✅ **Authentication Required** → Login required to access root route
- ✅ **Welcome Page** → Moved to `/welcome` (optional access)
- ✅ **Logout Redirect** → Now goes to `/login` instead of `/`

### **📱 User Experience Flow**
```
User visits: http://localhost:8000/
    ↓ (Not logged in)
Redirects to: /login
    ↓ (After successful login)
Redirects to: /dashboard
    ↓ (User works in system)
Logout → /login
```

## 🌐 **Updated Route Structure**

### **Root Route (Requires Authentication)**
```php
// Root route redirects to dashboard (requires authentication)
Route::get('/', function () {
    return redirect()->route('dashboard');
})->middleware(['auth', 'verified']);
```

### **Updated Redirect Flows**
```php
// After logout → Login page
$this->redirect('/login', navigate: true);

// After account deletion → Welcome page  
$this->redirect('/welcome', navigate: true);

// Logo clicks → Dashboard (with auth check)
href="{{ route('dashboard') }}"
```
